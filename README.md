This application is written using promises on the backend to access the data from the databse because the caching solution being implemted uses promises to get data and to send it. If anyone can change it and still have caching, you are welcome to do it.
The frontend has a results page that shows some information about the items, but not all of it because putting all the info in the result page will make it too convoluted. So, I made another page to put the information of the individdual item called itemCard.
